## Hola amiguitos

Milestone 03 was never merged into a release on its own; it was re-doing the merge of luk1337's unmerged lineage-18.1 patchset for oneplus_sdm845-common from the LineageOS gerrit over the crDroid 10.0 device tree, but still with a lot of ugly stuff from me messing with things I didn't understand earlier left in the commit history. This was the 'cleanest' one before I started trying to add DeviceSettings for February, but still not very clean.
