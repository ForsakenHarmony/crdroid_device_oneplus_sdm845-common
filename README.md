## Hola amiguitos

Milestone 04 was the February 2021 release, which didn't work as well as I thought it was going to. Sorry about panel color modes disappearing; they were supposed to be in LiveDisplay.

Next month will probably be trying to re-introduce DeviceSettings, but differently, with updated Illusion kernel instead of LOS (since luk1337 is unlikely to ever go back and merge all of the OnePlus OxygenOS Q codes from November 2019, and so it doesn't have the necessary kernel nodes to support the DeviceSettings hooks instead of the ones that lineage-sdk looks for).
