## Hola amiguitos

Ultimately I didn't know how to properly merge things, and this had a bunch of messy stuff left in the commit history. This is trying to merge in luk1337's unmerged lineage-18.1 patchset for oneplus_sdm845-common from the LineageOS gerrit over the crDroid 10.0 device tree, but a lot of ugly stuff from me messing with things I didn't understand earlier. This was the 'cleanest' one before trying to add DeviceSettings, but still not very clean.
