## Hola amiguitos

This was a dead-end first attempt to add in DeviceSettings stuff, swiped liberally from crdroidandroid/android_device_oneplus_avicii and AOSiP-Devices/device_oneplus_sdm845-common, but I really didn't have any idea what I was doing, and it never worked with crDroid (LOS) kernel due to not having the correct sysfs nodes.
